# Document Scanner and OCR

This project demonstrates a basic document scanner and OCR (Optical Character Recognition) using OpenCV and Tesseract. It includes image pre-processing, edge detection, contour detection, perspective transformation, and text extraction.

## Features
- **Image Pre-processing**: Resizing, grayscaling, and blurring.
- **Edge Detection**: Using Canny edge detection.
- **Contour Detection**: Finding and approximating contours to locate the document.
- **Perspective Transformation**: Transforming the detected document to a top-down view.
- **OCR**: Extracting text from the scanned document using Tesseract.
